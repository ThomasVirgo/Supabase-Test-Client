# Gandalf Refactor with SupaBase backend, React frontend

## To do list
- disallow users to send repeat requests to same user
- show feedback that a request has been sent on add friend modal
- consider adding redux so that can easily change state on button actions
- re style the add friend modal (need to account for overflow)
- add small pop ups for user feedback
