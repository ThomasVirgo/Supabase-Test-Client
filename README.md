# Gandalf Refactor with SupaBase backend, React frontend

## To do list
- add small pop ups for user feedback
- add user profile image and use supabase storage
- change storing room name in redux to persisting something in db so users can refresh page / disconnect and rejoin
- deal cards once host says so, not once all players ready
- dont let extra players join past 4 players or if game has started

### Priority
- show users joining on game page, add hover pop ups with username and total score
- update player scores and score history on completing a turn
- create a method called finishTurn for DRY code
- implement action cards, i.e. 7,8,9,10,J,Q

## Future features
- integrate gifs into messages
- have elo system and rankings
- add game rules page
