# Gandalf Refactor with SupaBase backend, React frontend

## To do list
- add small pop ups for user feedback
- add user profile image and use supabase storage
- change storing room name in redux to persisting something in db so users can refresh page / disconnect and rejoin
- deal cards once host says so, not once all players ready
- dont let extra players join past 4 players or if game has started

### Priority
- show users joining on game page and show the game code
- allow users to see their first two cards before starting



## Future features
- integrate gifs into messages
- have elo system and rankings
